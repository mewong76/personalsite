                <p style={Styles.body}>My father’s loving voice message on WeChat amazes me to this day. Like buried treasure, it still glows whenever I take the time to listen to it. Who knew that under the layers of sand on top of childhood dreams and seaweeds of financial burdens lay a hidden chest of golden advice from my immigrant father? Listening to his guru-like banter of universal sense of loss and confusion in love, I learn again and again that every person knows something I don’t.
                I broke up with my first real love when I was a junior in college. I let him go, and was so shaken that I seeked advice from my father. Love was never something we talked about growing up, so it didn’t seem like I was going to get anything out of it, but surely my father would have something nice for me to hear.
                My father is like Marlon, Nemo’s dad. Worried, frantic, but he was never overprotective. He prefers to let me fall into the toilet and learn myself what it’s like to be in the deep waters. For one, it’s a lot easier on him- and I appreciate that, and two, I almost think he knows what love truly means, to let go.
                The first night of the worst part of that breakup- the unexpected end, and the rebuilding of my life without him, I messaged my dad for hope. I felt like I had fallen deep inside the toilet now, full Nemo, and I had no idea how to feel better. I had put all my trust into someone else, and was just feeling the incredible sensation that is loss of a relationship that I pretended so long was not as bad as it truly was.
                Curled up in a ball, phone wretched in my hands, I clicked on my father’s message. My father’s voice responding to me still resonates with me today.
                “It’s all fate, Michelle. The one for you is out there.. Somewhere. It’s all fate.”
                I think it’s hilarious for a man who doesn’t believe in a particular religion, and never forced me to understand religion, telling me that love was all fate. Surely if you tried hard enough, if you swam fast enough, covered enough of the ocean, you will be able to find your one fish, no? I didn’t believe what my father was saying. But that did not matter. What mattered was that I got a peek at the sunken treasure that is father wisdom, something I had found for the first time after growing up with him and never even scratching the surface. What love there is to be had when one is vulnerable. What love there is to be had when there is one to give it.
                Treasure.
